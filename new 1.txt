                                      GIT NOTES-
									  
What is Git?
Git is an open-source distributed version control system. It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. 
It is developed to co-ordinate the work among the developers. The version control allows us to track and work together with our team members at the same workspace.

Git is foundation of many services like GitHub and GitLab, but we can use Git without using any other Git services. Git can be used privately and publicly.

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to develop Linux Kernel. It is also used as an important distributed version-control tool for the DevOps.

Git is easy to learn, and has fast performance. It is superior to other SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase.

Features of Git
Some remarkable features of Git are as follows

Open Source
Git is an open-source tool. It is released under the GPL (General Public License) license.

Scalable
Git is scalable, which means when the number of users increases, the Git can easily handle such situations.

Distributed
One of Git's great features is that it is distributed. Distributed means that instead of switching the project to another machine, we can create a "clone" of the entire repository. 
Also, instead of just having one central repository that you send changes to, every user has their own repository that contains the entire commit history of the project.
 We do not need to connect to the remote repository; the change is just stored on our local repository. If necessary, we can push these changes to a remote repository.


Security
Git is secure. It uses the SHA1 (Secure Hash Function) to name and identify objects within its repository. 
Files and commits are checked and retrieved by its checksum at the time of checkout. 
It stores its history in such a way that the ID of particular commits depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit. 
Once it is published, one cannot make changes to its old version.

Speed
Git is very fast, so it can complete all the tasks in a while. Most of the git operations are done on the local repository, so it provides a huge speed. 
Also, a centralized version control system continually communicates with a server somewhere.
Performance tests conducted by Mozilla showed that it was extremely fast compared to other VCSs. 
Fetching version history from a locally stored repository is much faster than fetching it from the remote server. 
The core part of Git is written in C, which ignores runtime overheads associated with other high-level languages.
Git was developed to work on the Linux kernel; therefore, it is capable enough to handle large repositories effectively. 
From the beginning, speed and performance have been Git's primary goals.

Supports non-linear development
Git supports seamless branching and merging, which helps in visualizing and navigating a non-linear development. 
A branch in Git represents a single commit. We can construct the full branch structure with the help of its parental commit.
